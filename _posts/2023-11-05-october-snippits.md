# Little Sketches

While waiting for a friend on a street corner in the Mission, I noticed someone in a laudrymat who was trying to get change from a machine set in the wall. The machine kept rejecting her bill and she kept pushing the bill back in, mechanically pushing the bill with two hands in the same motion over and over again. It's funny how in interacting with a machine, you are reduced in a way to its mechanicalism. "When you gaze long into the void, the void gazes also into you."

I've been using, as a bookmark, a cheap business card from the Putnum Ram dealer in Burlingame. I have no idea where I got this business card - I don't think I've actually ever been inside a Ram in my life and I haven't been in Burlingame either in over ten years. It recently traveled with me to India where, at some point, I lost it. Somewhere in Chettinad there's probably an Indian man now who is using it as a coaster or something wondering where it came from.

# Watched

- In the Mood for Love - Wong Kar-wai

  *Features the music of Lin Giong, a Tawiwanese composer and DJ. While watching this, I wondered whether "Still Life" referred to still life artwork or if it was a description of the life depicted. Maybe both? There was a particularly beautiful scene where Shen Hong is discussing divorce wtih her absent husband, set against the industrial backdrop of the Three Gorges Dam*

Quick note on In the Mood for Love: I've been watching a lot of film that features the theme of forbidden attachment (Past Lives, In the Mood for Love, and even Still Life). This has definately been a thing that takes up a lot of space in my mind the past few years and I want to spend some time introspecting about it when I have the chance.
