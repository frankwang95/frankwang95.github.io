Many years ago, I spent several years intensely practicing photography. This hobby was the source of a lot of relationships I made during my years in school and also my love of the outdoors. Since college, however, my interest in taking photos waned. Contributing to this were other interests I found and the decline of Facebook where I had shared most of my work. When I returned home from school, I found that my entire archive of photos - two terabytes worth - was lost to hard disk failure. This was immensely discouraging and I spent many years completely away from the practice.

A friend of mine was married late last year. When I was asked to take photos for her, I considered it an honor and agreed. I purchased a new camera and have been since regularly using it. 2023 was a tumultuous year for me and I've found an increasingly strong desire to find places to record my thoughts and experiences. This blog started as a place to write about mathematics and machine learning. However, in the absence of other places I liked, I thought this blog could also be a place for me to write about the other things I happen to love in the moment. In the near future this will probably mean books, music, and pictures though it will probably mean math again at some point. Nobody really reads this blog anyways and quite frankly that was never really the point to begin with.

I have been actively working to recover lost work from years past and I intended to regularly share this work as it progresses. Here are a few frames I've found thus far.
