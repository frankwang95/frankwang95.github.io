I am an experienced C++ and Python SWE with 8 years of experience specializing in a few technical areas:
* XXXPiB scale MapReduce style pipelines (Spark, Hadoop, DataFlow)
* High performance scientific computing and machine learning (scipy, numpy, scikit, HDF5, Cython, jax, Tensorflow)
* 2D and 3D object detection, localization, and clustering models including training with hybrid 2D-3D co-supervision.
* Probabilistic model calibration and out-of-distribution robustness.

> Senior Software Engineer - Geo  
> Feb 2019 - Present

* Conceptualized, designed, and led four engineers across four teams to implement Geo's current 3D object localization and clustering system from scratch, processing 20PiB of StreetView pixel and LiDAR data per week. My algorithm exceeded Google's previous SoTA quality by 5pp F1 score across a broad range of object types and reduces processing latency from 94.3%.
* Implemented improvements to the heuristic used to associate businesses to StreetView imagery in the Google Maps UI which reduced the number of businesses with incorrect associations by 32pp.
* Published a paper on empirical model generalization on out-of-distribution data with Dan Hendricks and Justin Gilmer which was presented as a conference paper at ICCV and has been cited 2100+ times.
* Implemented experiments on surface smoothness regularization to improve NeRF quality on sparsely collected imagery.

**LogMeIn**

> Software Engineer - Machine Intelligence  
> June 2017 - Jan 2019

* Maintained production infrastructure for serving and continuously retraining a collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm.
* Initial creator of the subject segmentation model that is used for artificial depth-of-field and green screen features in GoToMeeting today. I collected data for the model using the iPhone's front facing depth camera, then trained a off-the-shelf UNet. The model was then optimized to achieve 40fps CPU inference via a combination of distillation and custom CUDA kernels for separable convolutions/deconvolutions.

**Argonne Natn. Lab**

> Statistician Intern - Lab of Eugene Y. Yan  
> May 2016 - Aug 2016

* Implemented the shuffled complex evolution genetic optimization algorithm to calibrate the parameters of a global hydrology model on data collected from the GRACE satellite using Argonneâ€™s MIRA and LCRC supercomputing clusters.
