My name is Frank. I live in San Francisco, CA. I am into math, music, literature, poetry, the outdoors, wine, politics, philosophy, photography, and a whole lot of other things. I'll probably write about some of those things here. I'm an UChicago grad and Googler. I also volunteer with the Marin County Search and Rescue team in my free time.

This blog started as a place for me to write about mathematics and statistics and had, for a while, a very professional flavor. Nowadays it's mostly a big-boy Tumblr blog.

Everything here is riddled with typos and errors, and there's nothing I don't find a bit cringe within 2 hours of being put up.
