I recently graduated from the University of Chicago with degrees in mathematics and statistics. I now work on the Machine Learning team at LogMeIn in sunny Santa Barbara, California. This blog contains writings on math, stats, and machine learning. Many posts are intended to be notes to myself on experiments and derivations I do in my free time and might consequently contain way too much or way too little mathematical detail. That being said, questions, comments, and discussion are always welcome.
