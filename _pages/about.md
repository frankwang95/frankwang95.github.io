My name is Frank. I live in San Francisco, CA.

This blog started as a place for me to write about mathematics and statistics and had, for a while, a very professional flavor. Nowadays it's mostly a big-boy Tumblr blog. Expect my interests and consistency to swing wildy. Everything here is riddled with typos and errors.

I'm an UChicago grad and Googler. I also volunteer with the Marin County Search and Rescue team in my free time.
