I recently graduated from the University of Chicago with degrees in mathematics and statistics. After leaving school, I spent a year and a half working on the Communicaton and Collaboration Machine Learning team at LogMeIn before joining Google in Mountain View, California. In my current role, I work on large-scale machine-vision for Geo Data.

My general interests are in machine-learning, information theory, functional analysis, and differential topology. I am particularly invested in studying the theoretical foundations, safety, interpretability, and fairness of statistical models. My recently reading includes topics on latent variable autoencoders, neural ODES, and group theoretic convolution.

This blog contains writings on math, stats, and machine learning. Many posts are intended to be notes to myself on experiments and derivations I do in my free time and might consequently contain way too much or way too little mathematical detail. That being said, questions, comments, and discussion are always welcome.
